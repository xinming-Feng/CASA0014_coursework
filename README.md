## Prototypes and ideas
Temperature and humidity are two important indicators in daily life. The change of temperature and humidity can lead to a change in people's body comfort. However, in daily life, people can intuitively see the changes in temperature and humidity, but can't observe the indoor or outdoor body comfort. The comfortable temperature (or humidity) plus the uncomfortable humidity (or temperature) will also lead to bad body feeling.</br>

Therefore, I hope to have an index that can combine temperature and humidity, and obtain an index through certain calculations, which more intuitively reflects the direct effect of temperature and humidity on human comfort. And convert the values into color information, to Chrono Lumina, so that people can more quickly and directly see the body comfort.</br>

The index I used is heat index(HI), which can combine temperature and humidity in a hot environment.</br>

## Device Introduction 
### Sensor
DHT22
### Functionality
1.When the heat index goes from low to high, the color of the light changes from blue. Green -&gt; Huang -&gt; Red. Thus, the body comfort can be intuitively seen.</br>
2.
